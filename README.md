## My thoughts on the test

1. I didn't add React Navigation because it was a simple app with at the end just one screen so it wasn't worth it.
2. Also I didn't use a Global State Manangement like Redux, Context API or Zustand, because the app it was small and in this case just needed it to pass the state to one child component, so it was not worth it.
3. At the end one test doesn't show the skills that you have but I tried to show you how I have been working and also I would like an opportunity to keep learning from the best at ROOTS. So if you are looking for someone like me just let me know and I'll be willing to join a great company like yours.
